      W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group;

  <section id="purpose">
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The intended audience for the [VC-GUIDE] ("Guide") is a broad range of professionals interested in
      furthering
      the application of Verifiable Credentials technology for use in software apps, agents, and services.
      The primary audience includes software architects, application developers, and user experience (UX)
      specialists;
      as well as other people involved in a broad range of standards efforts related to decentralized identity,
      verifiable credentials, and secure storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of the Guide is to satisfy
      the following goals and non-goals in a way that meets the needs of the intended audience.
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ol>
      <p>The primary goal of the Guide is to provide a <i>first entry point</i> or <i>landing area</i> to help readers:
        <li>Locate each of the documents that are part of the collection of [VCWG] deliverables that, in turn, describe
          what Verifiable Credentials are and how to use them ("Documentation");
          as well as how to test conformance of a Verifiable Credential implementation against the Documentation.</li>
        <li>Understand the purpose of each deliverable in the Documentation as well as understand the relationships
          between each pair of the deliverables (as appropriate).</li>
        <li>For specific key topics, understand where in the Documentation to look for help; for example, key topics
          might include Data Model, Conformance, Use Cases, Specific Data Platform Considerations, External Resources,
          etc.</li>
        <li>Project the Documentation as a comprehensive body of knowledge about Verified Credentials (or at least a
          great starting point).</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Non-Goals</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The guide is not a <i>Primer</i> in the classic W3C sense. A list of Primer examples is available in the CCG
        mailing
        list.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Drivers</h3>
